# Un-Happy Path Cucumber Integration Tests

* This directory contains Cucumber `feature` files that define an unhappy path for the Accounts features.
* The tests cover the following scenarios:
    - Finding an account by an invalid `user_id`
* These tests are intended to verify that the core functionality of the Accounts features work to provide
  acceptable output and signaling when clients/consumers make errors when using the API.
